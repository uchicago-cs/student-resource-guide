<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This page provides some useful guidelines on how to ask questions
in your classes (and more specifically on an online discussion board).
If you have questions about this guide (e.g., if you need help working
through any of the instructions provided in this guide), please see the
<a class="reference internal" href="../about/getting-help.html#about-help"><span class="std std-ref">Getting Help</span></a> page in the “About This Guide” section.</p>
</div>
<p>As you work through your coursework, many of you will probably have
questions or will encounter issues that you are not sure how to
handle. Your course staff will typically set up some form of online
discussion board for this very purpose, usually through Canvas or Ed
Discussion.</p>
<p>Online discussion boards provide a
convenient mechanism to ask questions, but it can sometimes be
challenging for course staff to help you if you do not provide the right
information when asking a question. Here are a few suggestions that may
help you ask questions more effectively on an online discussion board:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before you post a question…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Search before asking</strong>. Before posting a question on the
discussion board, check whether it has already been answered in a
previous post. We realize the volume of posts can be overwhelming,
but you should start by using the discussion board’s search
functionality to see if it brings up any relevant posts. For
example, suppose you are failing a specific test in a programming assignment;
you could search just for that test’s name to see if any
other students have encountered that same error (and, if you’re
lucky, an instructor/TA will have already answered it).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure to formulate an actual question to ask</strong>. Make sure
you are describing a specific issue you’re encountering, and why you’re
stuck on it (e.g., you are not getting the expected result, the
tests are failing in a way you do not understand, etc.). Writing a
post that says “I can’t get Task 4 to work, I’ve pushed my code.
Please look at it.” is not a question: it is a request for someone
to debug your code for you. Try instead to describe the exact
reason why you’re stuck (we provide concrete suggestions on how to
do this below). If you’re struggling to do so, you may want to
go to <a class="reference internal" href="office-hours.html#getting-help-office-hours"><span class="std std-ref">office hours</span></a> to get help
more interactively.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Public vs private questions</strong>. Discussion boards often have
mechanisms that allow you to ask private questions, which will be
seen only by the instructors and teaching assistants. Typically, this
mechanism should be used only for truly private matters that relate
uniquely to you (e.g., you need to notify the course staff of a family/medical
emergency, etc.).</p>
<p>Of course, when you run into an issue on an assignment, it may seem like
“it applies only to you” because it relates to your code. However,
it’s possible that other students will run into the exact same issue
you ran into. So, questions about coursework, course logistics, etc.
do not qualify as “private matters”, and should typically be
asked publicly. This way, everyone can benefit from the
answer to the question and, if someone runs into the same issue you
do, course staff can refer them to the answer they provided in your post.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The more information, the better</strong>. We know that, in some
classes, you may feel the need to be brief and concise when asking
for help to “avoid wasting the professor’s time” or because
“professors don’t have time to read long e-mails”. The absolute
opposite is true in most CS classes: when asking for help, we prefer
that you <em>overwhelm</em> us with information.</p>
<p>In particular, it will be much easier for course staff to help you if they are
able to reproduce the exact issue you are encountering (i.e., when
they run your code, they must be able to observe the exact same issue
you’re encountering). And to do so, they need as much information as
possible from you:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>If your question relates to your code, and your class is using a
version-control system (e.g. git, svn, etc), make
sure you push your code to the server (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, PhoenixForge) before asking for help.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you’re running your code on a <a class="reference internal" href="../environment/environment.html#software-environment"><span class="std std-ref">UChicago CS software environment</span></a>.
Course staff will not be able to provide
assistance if you are running your code on your personal machine,
as this will make it harder for them to reproduce the exact issue
you are encountering.</p></li>
<li><p>Include a detailed description of the exact chain of events that
lead to the issue you’re encountering (Are you testing a specific
function? If so, with what inputs? Does the issue come up when you
run a test? Etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>If you encounter an error message (or any other unexpected output)
when running a command or a specific test, please make sure you
include the command that you ran and the <strong>full and unabridged</strong> error message (or unexpected
output). Summarizing the message (e.g., “The tests says it was
expecting value 42, and I’m pretty sure that’s what I’m
returning”) makes it harder for course staff to identify the issue.</p></li>
<li><p>If something is “wrong”, please describe in what way it seems
wrong to you. For example, were you expecting a particular output
but got a different one? Is a piece of code behaving in a way you
were not expecting? Etc. It can be useful to describe what you were
expecting the code to do, and what you encountered instead.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>What <em>not</em> to include in your question:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p><strong>Never post your code on an online discussion board</strong>. If
you need the course staff to look at your code, and your class
uses a version control system, just push it to the server
(e.g. GitHub, GitLab, PhoenixForge) and the course staff
will look at it there. Please note that, if a test prints out a
few lines of code as part of its output, that is typically acceptable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No screenshots</strong>. Do not post screenshots of the command or the output.
Screenshots are not searchable, and may pose readability issues
for some people. Instructors/TAs may also want to copy-paste your
command elsewhere, which is not possible if you post a
screenshot.</p>
<p>If you need to share some output from the terminal, copy-paste from the
terminal onto the discussion board, and use the discussion board’s
“code block” or “verbatim” formatting. To copy something on the terminal, just
select it (the same way you would do in a word processor: click,
and then drag until the end of the output) and press
Control-Shift-C (Command-C on MacOS).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>One question, one post</strong>. Avoid posts that have multiple unrelated
questions. Instead, write a separate post for each question. Please
note that it is ok to ask multiple questions in one post if they all
relate to the same issue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comments vs Answers</strong>. Some discussion board distinguish between
“answering” a question and adding a “comment” on an existing question.
In those cases, you should use the “comment” functionality if you’d like
to provide additional information on a question, or have a follow-up question.
You should use the “answer” functionality only if you are providing an
actual answer to the question (including if you’ve resolved the issue
on your own, so the question is flagged as “answered”).</p></li>
</ul>
