Getting Help
============

If you need any assistance with any of the instructions or tutorials in this guide,
please use one of the following support mechanisms:

- **If you were referred to this guide by the course staff of a class you are taking**:
  Please use the support mechanisms provided in that class. For example, if the instructor
  for a class you're taking has instructed you to work through the Git tutorial,
  and you run into any issues while doing so, so should use whatever support mechanisms
  are available in that class (online discussion board, office hours, etc.) to get assistance
  with that issue.

- **If you are working through this guide on your own**: You are welcome to seek support through
  the following channels:

  - **UChicago CS Slack**: You can ask questions about the guide on the ``#student-resource-guide`` channel. If
    you are not on the UChicago CS Slack, you can join using this link: https://cs-uchicago.slack.com/signup
    The sign up form will ask you to provide a ``@cs.uchicago.edu`` address. If you have ever registered
    for a CS class, you actually have a ``CNETID@cs.uchicago.edu`` e-mail address that, by default,
    will forward to your UChicago e-mail. If you have never registered for a CS account, but you
    have a UChicago CNetID, please `request a CS account <https://account-request.cs.uchicago.edu/account/requests>`__ first.
  - **UChicago CS Discord**: You can ask questions about the guide on the ``#student-resource-guide`` channel.
    If you are not on the UChicago CS Discord, you can use the following invite link: https://discord.gg/ZVjX8Gv
    Please note that, when you join the Discord server, you will have limited access to the server
    until you perform an authentication step with your CNetID (when you join the server, a bot will
    provide further instructions on how to do so). Once you have authenticated, you must go to the
    ``#roles`` channel to obtain the "Student Resource Guide" role (so you can have
    access to the ``#student-resource-guide`` channel)

Please note that all of the above support mechanisms are **for University of Chicago students, staff,
and faculty only**. If you are unaffiliated with the University of Chicago, you will not be able
to access our Slack or Discord server.
